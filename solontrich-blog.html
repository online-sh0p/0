                <h2>The Problem with Modern Online Shopping</h2>
                <p>We've all been there—endless scrolling through countless product listings, reading conflicting reviews, comparing prices across multiple tabs, and still feeling uncertain about making the right purchase. Online shopping has given us unprecedented access to products, but it's also created a paradox of choice that leaves many consumers overwhelmed and frustrated.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Did you know?</strong> The average online shopper spends over 6 hours per week browsing products, comparing options, and searching for the best deals. That's valuable time that could be spent on things that truly matter.
